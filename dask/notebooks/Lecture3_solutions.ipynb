    "Distributing our dataset into a large number of small partitions enables parallel processing in each node.\n",

    "\n",
    "As the user of the distributed processing system, it is **our** (not Dask's or Spark's) job to decide and optimize the number of partitions.\n",
    "The distributed framework will first operate a choice or a guess, but the optimization of the performances depend on us making the right choice depending on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, loading up data from a set of files, initially the number of partitions might be the exactly the number of the CSV files from which we are importing data. \n",
    "However, over time, as we reduce or increase the size of our DataFrames by filtering or joining, it may be wise to reconsider how many partitions we need to optimize Dask scheduler overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_There is always a cost associated in having too many or having too few partitions, but unfortunately, at the same time we don't have a single rule to decide which is the single \"right\" number of partitions._\n",

    "But at the same time, they must not be too many, such as the central scheduler overhead becomes impacting the performances of our computation.\n",
